# Stable-Matching-Model

## Tradeoffs 
One tradeoff in our Stable Matching Model is that 

- visualization assumes that the groups in the match will only be man/woman, 
but in our model in the code, we abstract this out so that we can have any 
two groups defined

## Assumptions and Limitations
- limit in the number of men/women, since can't do a higher order


## Change of Goals
- no longer checking for uniqueness of matching
